## Types of Control Systems
### Proportional Control
- The control system reacts to errors proportionally

## Classifications of Industrial Controllers.
- __Automatic Controller__ an automatic controller compares the actual value of the plant output with the reference input (desired value) determines the deviation and produces a control signal that will reduce the deviation to zero or to a small value
$$
    e(t) \text { or } E(S) \text{ is the threshold of the actuating signal } \\\\
    u(t) \text{ or } U(s) \text{ is the output of the controller }
$$
### Two-position (onâ€“off controllers)

- Element being controlled only has two states (typically on or off)
- Simple and inexpensive so they are widely used
- __differential gap__: The range through which the actuating error signal must move before the switching occurs
- The thermostat of a room set at 20C might turn on at 18C and turn off at 22 having a differential gap of 4C
- The basic premise is the system turns on when a threshold has been reached and off when the threshold reaches a desired value

$$
    u(t) = U_{1}, \text{for } e(t) > 0 \\\\
    = U_{2}, \text{for} e(t) < 0 \\\\
    U_{1} \text{ is the ON value } \\\\
    U_{2} \text{ is the OFF value}
$$

## Proportional controllers
- A linear feedback control system where the controller output is proportional to the error signal
- Used when a system is a relatively long response time
    - Will control a system better because the error can be dampened before there is an output
- Is essentially an amplifier with an adjustable gain

$$
    u(t) = K_{p}e(t) \\\\
    \mathscr{L} \text{\{$u(t)$\}} =  \frac{U(s)}{E(s)} = K_{p} \\\\
    K_{p} = \text{proportional gain}
$$

## Integral controllers
- The value of the controller output u(t) is changed at a rate proportional to the actuating error signal e(t)
- This process starts slowly but overtime it begins to really eliminate errors

$$
    \frac{du(t)}{dt} = K_{i} e(t) \\\\
    \text{ or } \\\\
    u(t) = K_{i}\int{0}^{t}e(t)dt
$$

## Derivative Controller

- The controller output is proportional to the rate of change of the measurement or error
- The controller output is calculated by the rate of change of the deviation or error with time

$$
    u(t) = - k_{D} \frac{dEr}{dt}
$$

## Additional Classifications of Industrial Controllers

The above controllers can be combined (through addition) to be the below combinations

1. Proportional-plus-integral controllers
2. Proportional-plus-derivative controllers
3. Proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative controllers
