| Term | Definition |
|:----:| :-------- |
| Node| Point representing a variable or a signal |
| Source| A node without incoming branches (input node) |
| Sink | A node with incoming branches only (output nodes) |
| Mixed Node | Both incoming and outgoing nodes |
| Path  | Connected branches in the direction of the branch arrows. If a node is crossed more than once it is closed|
| Forward Path | From input node to output node without crossing nodes more than once |
| Loop | Closed path |
| Non touching loops | Loops that do not possess common nodes |

## Properties of Signal Flow Graphs
1. A branch indicates the functional dependence of one signal on another. A signal passes through each branch that is connected
2. A node adds the signals of all incoming branches and transmits this sum to all outgoing branches
3. A mixed node with both incoming and outgoing branches can be treated as a sink by adding an outgoing branch of unity transmittance. But you cannot change a mixed node to a source by this method.
4. For a given system the signal flow graph is not unique

## Mason's Formula

$$
    p = \frac{1}{\Delta} \sum_{k} P_{k} \Delta_{k}
$$
